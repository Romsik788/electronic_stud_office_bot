## Usage

Before you launch bot,  you have to do next:

1. Import data base file **telegram_bot.sql** into MySQL server. Also, your server has to have your system`s database. Preferably to use MySQL 8.0 or higher. As a server we recommend to use [OpenServer](https://ospanel.io/).

2. Then you have create a path to botâ€™s data base, and to electronic system. To make is possible you have to find methods those like **query_to_bot_database** and **queryToDB** and find in them some specific parameters. (for example lets look at the **query_to_bot_database**)
```python
with connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="root",
    password="",
    database="telegram_bot",
)
```
These fields are used to gain an access to Data Base, and they have to be changed according to your settings.

**host** - Your MySQL servers address.

**user** and **password** - In these fields you have to mention user name and password, which is going to get an access to *telegram_bot* data base onto your MySQL server.

**database** - In this field you may claim a new name for your database.

3. Change in field **token** onto personal token

Now you are allowed to launch bot.
```bash
python bot.py
```
